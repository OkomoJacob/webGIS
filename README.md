## The WebGIS Starting Point
### What is web mapping?
A web map is an interactive display of geographic information, in the form of a web page, that you can use to tell stories and answer questions in an interactive manner, unlike in the old stand alone Desktop GIS alone.Good to note is that a Web Map is fully powered by the web, rather than digital maps alone.
