## Repository Main Objectives/Goals
My wish is that at the end of this scoll, you are in that minimum position to:
1. Build and publish basic websites and web maps both in PC and Mobile Phone browsers (Android 6+ and iOS)
2. Use JavaScript to add interactive behavior in your maps
3. Connect you web map to a database to display large amounts of data
4. Include client-side geoprocessing functionality in your web map
5. Gain an understanding on how the web works, and a starting point for learning more
## The WebGIS Starting Point
### What is web mapping?
A web map is an interactive display of geographic information, in the form of a web page, that you can use to tell stories and answer questions in an interactive manner, unlike in the old stand alone Desktop GIS alone.Good to note is that a Web Map is fully powered by the web, rather than digital maps alone.<br> 
[-] This means that the map is usually not self-contained; in other words, it depends on
the internet. At least some of the content displayed on a web maps is usually loaded from
other locations on the web, such as a tile server
 
#### Functions of Web Maps
Web maps are useful for various purposes, such as 
* Data visualization in journalism 
* Displaying real-time spatial data
* Powering spatial queries in online catalogs and search tools
* Providing computational tools 
* Reporting
* Collaborative mapping among others
